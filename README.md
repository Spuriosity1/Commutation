# Commutation Station for Operator Elimination

A proof assistant tool for the busy physicist, to be used in evaluating large commutator expressions.
This package does symbolic algebra on noncommutative objects. 

The relevant objects for most purposes are `CommutatorAlgebra`, `Expression` and `Term`. An `Expression` is a list of `Term`s, together with standard vector space operations.
