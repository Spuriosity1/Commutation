# Commutation Station for Operator Elimination

A proof assistant tool for the busy physicist, to be used in evaluating large commutator expressions.
This package soes symbolic algebra on noncommutative objects. 

The relevant objects for most purposes are `CommutatorAlgebra`, `Expression` and `Term`. An `Expression` is a list of `Term`s, together with standard vector space operations.



# TODO
 - Exporting code to mlve result to mathematica or similar
 - Implement use of anticommutator algebra
 - Factorisation
 - Scalar subclass of Term (in general, import sympy to simplify scalar coefficients?
